# Caesar Cipher - Application

- This application takes a file text input and encrypts it using the [Caesar Cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/).
- Created on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)

# Installation

- Clone the project locally on your machine and build main.cpp in the terminal:

```bash
$ g++ main main.cpp
```

- Than run the program using the following cmd (for decryption use -d):
(the KEY can be changed - it has to be between _1_ and _25_)

```bash
$ ./main -e 5
```

#Output
- Not only is the encrypted text shown in the console, but it is also stored in the _output.txt_ file, along side the key used for encryption.
